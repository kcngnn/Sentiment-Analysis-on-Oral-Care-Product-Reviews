# Sentiment-Analysis-on-an-Oral-Care-Product-Reviews

This is the team project in fulfillment for the *Consulting* course, in which we worked on solving a real business case at a pharmaceutical client company. 

In the project, we applied different NLP techniques on an oral care brand of the company. 

The study serves two purposes: <br/>
- To extract customer insights related to overall brand perception and its product features that receive top attention from customers.<br/>
- To visualize customer perceptions about brands across the oral care sector to understand how Brand A is positioned against its competitors.<br/>
These two objectives bring the team to the final goal of helping the company to understand how customers communicate about the brand and where perception or performance could be improved.
